# Planters-Community-System
This System is planned to be developed through free and open-source methods.

There are some limitaions that can be listed as following:

1.The System will be implemented by high-level Language like JAVA and JAVASCRIPT.

2. The System will be accessed by the government (Ministry of Municipalities Affairs & Urban Planning) and (Ministry of agriculture) to create supervised forestation events.

The application is intended to support the national initiative for agricultural development in Bahrain
by increasing the awareness of the agricultural sector among the citizens.
t will provide a digital platform that offers accurate academic information to guide the users in
taking care of their plants and offers an easy way of communication between the small farmers and agricultural experts directly,
for the purpose of helping them to use the modern agricultural methods and enhancing their plants.
As a result, it will unify the efforts to empower micro projects and enlarge the green spaces in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
As a team of software engineers, it will allow us to explore a new domain not particularly common in Bahrain which will help us enhance both our problem-solving skills
and teamwork skills.
